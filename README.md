# CIME Package Index pypi.cime.dev

Company-specific package index, and it's transparent!

Wait - why transparent?

Because this setup enables package installation whether the user installs from
PyPI or pypi.cime.dev, all using the **same** `pip` command.

How cool is that?

More documentation coming soon!
